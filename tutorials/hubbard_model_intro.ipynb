    "This notebook introduces the Hubbard Model$^1$ for use with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The Hubbard Model (HM) has a range of uses, most notably in solid-state physics to explain phase transitions and other correlated behaviors. There are several variations of the HM, but in essence, the model describes interacting particles on a lattice. Despite its apparent simplicity, it is hard to solve on a classical computer because the known algorithms scale exponentially unless further approximations are made. In this tutorial, we will use the VQE algorithm to estimate the energy ground states of different configurations of a HM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hubbard Model is useful for testing a quantum software stack, because it is easy to scale without changing its fundamental behavior, allowing apple to apple comparisons. Specific to VQE, its properties make it possible, within limits, to separately change the complexity of the quantum and the classical parts of the algorithm, stressing each individually. Furthermore, the resource requirements for running a full software chain on small configurations are low enough to fit and run on a laptop, within the time constraints of a software tutorial setting."

    "A visualization of an example of the Fermi-Hubbard Model, on a 2x2 grid with spinful electrons, is shown below. Electrons being fermions means that two electrons can not occupy the same quantum state. Because the electrons have spin, there can thus be at most two electrons per site (one spin-up, one spin-down). The model is characterized by an interaction term 'U', which only contributes if a spin-up and a spin-down electron occupy the same site; and by a \"hopping\" term 't', representing the kinetic energy in the system. In this basic model, only hops to neighboring sites are considered.\n",

This is because $a_j^\\dagger a_j a_j$ is `0`, because $a_j a_j$ is `0` (from the anti-commutation relations). Similarly, $a_j^\\dagger$ can be shown to \"create\" an electron if the current state is an eigenstate with eigenvalue `0`, i.e. it yields the eigenstate with eigenvalue `1`. Applying either $a_j$ or $a_j^\\dagger$ a second time yields `0` in both cases.\n",

Second, each operation involves a string of operations back onto all previously mapped states, to ensure the correct parity, and consequently the operations are non-local, with the last mapping (potentially) operating on <i>all</i> qubits. On a noisy quantum computer, this means that the last fermion operator will have an outsized impact on noise in the final result, which may lead to bias.

    "\n",
    "Not all combinations of $j$ and $k$ indices appear in our model: hopping is only allowed between neighboring sites on the grid and is spin-preserving; interaction only occurs between opposite spins at a site. Since fermions are interchangeable, we're free to choose any qubit labeling from state to qubit and if the quantum computer does not have all-to-all connectivity, labeling will make a difference for the overall circuit depth. (Note that the labeling is a practical, not mathematical, matter: the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev transforms are fully reversible.) When OpenFermion performs the either transform on a FermionOperator, it will leave the existing index ordering in place, thus the labeling can be controlled by changing the indices in the fermion terms.\n",

    "Solving the Hubbard Model Classically\n",
    "---------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "An analytical solution is only known for the 1D Hubbard Model.$^{10}$ Another approach is exact diagonalization of the operator matrix. Unfortunately, the matrix size grows exponentially with the number of states, so that quickly becomes infeasible (at least, for classical computations). However, since in this tutorial we're only considering relatively small models (to be able to classically simulate them as run on a quantum computer, a process that is likewise size-limited), the exact diagonalization will do fine to solve our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact diagonalization will provide the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the model. However, the overall energy in the system depends on the number of electrons we added to the model. Given a state, represented by an eigenvector, we thus also need to know for how many electrons (and whether up or down) it occurs. Since the overall number of electrons as well as their spin numbers are conserved, we're only interested in states that represent a whole number of electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need some operators to count the electrons, given an input state. They are constructed in the following code block and consist of applying the, earlier introduced, counter operator $a_j^\\dagger a_j$ to the relevant sites."
